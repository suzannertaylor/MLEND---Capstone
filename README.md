* keras

You will also need to install Jupyter Notebook to run the program


### Code

Code is provided in the kepler.ipynb. The datasets are contained in the input directory or can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data. If the datasets are obtained fron Kaggle they must be located in the input directory for the program to run.

### Run 
In terminal or command window, navigate to the directory containing the ipynb file and run the following command:
